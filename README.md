# momentmap1

The first real-time map that respects your privacy and brings your inner circle to you.

You can use Minutemap to:
-Find out where all the fun is at
-Start a conversation 
-Meet up with your friends
-Visualize where your friends are
-See what's happening within your friends' group

How it works:
Privately send your location to your friends along with a picture or message. Once your friend has viewed the message, your message disappears.

Minutemap does not track your location, so the location you send with your message will not be updated.

Minutemap will never post to your Facebook account.

Never miss out with Minutemap.

*** "Yes, Minutemap is now on the App Store. Since it's spontaneous upload on the App Store, this new social media app turning previous stigmas about location sharing upside down. Minutemap is a location-sharing application but it does it in such a way that respects your privacy with ease. Your location is short-lived, meaning that Minutemap never tracks your location after you press send. So the location you send with your picture or message is never updated. However, this is not the app's most notable feature. That spot belongs to it's ever growing user base that allows for you to connect to your friends and view what pictures and messages they send you along with their location. At a University, this means connecting the user to where everyone is having fun at, whether that is bars, lecture halls, or restaurants. This app has been introduced to the students at the University of Virginia but is open to all. Keep an eye out for what this app grows into in the future." ***
